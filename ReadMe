ASSUMPTIONS MADE
----------------
1. During Regex Matching we have ommitted all words/names with unicode characters.
2. We have not ommitted roman numerals considering them as words.
3. All punctuations are removed
4. words formed by two words and hyphen are split into two. Eg: day-break as day and break.
